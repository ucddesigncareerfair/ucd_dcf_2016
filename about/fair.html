    The UC Davis Design Career Fairaims to empower students to take risks not only in their designs, but also career aspirations. By providing students career resources, we strive to bridge our talented designers to esteemed companies. 
    <br><br>
    In 2015, the Design Career Fair was launched by a group of design students. We saw potential in the Design Department to strengthen and grow in their career resources for students and post-grad opportunities. Starting from the bottom up, design students volunteered their time to build the Design Career Fair from its visual identity to employer relations base. What drove us? Knowing what we were doing will help students for years to come.  While UC Davis fosters student designers through education, we foster student growth through empowerment.
    <br><br>
    Beyond our annual career fair, our goal is to create workshop series and resources for students to access all year long. In order to make better career fair experiences for both students and employers, we constantly are evaluating and reiterating what we have accomplished. Each year we plan to increase our student involvement, our employer members, and the success rates of hiring students.
    <br><br>
    On a larger scope, we are creating an environment that supports a diverse range of designers, from design emphases to individual identities. We plan to establish UC Davis Designâ€™s reputation in the progressive design community.
    <br><br>
    Sponsored by the continued support and generosity of alumni Julie and Randy Merk.
