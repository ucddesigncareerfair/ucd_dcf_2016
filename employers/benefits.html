    <p>Why visit the Univesity of California at Davis on March 22nd, 2016? To find a rising star, to fill a vacancy, to review portfolios and help out young designers on the path to glory and skillfullness. But what else? Why hire from UC Davis, and why attend this fair, this March? Two reasons: Davis Designers are more than just designers, and our career fair is more than just passing out business cards. Multitalented students, interactive exhibits, profeshional networking, and plenty of swag await you!</p>
    <h3><strong>[INTERDISCLIPINARY]</strong> Student Talent</h3>
    <p>Students in Design program at UC Davis beneif from being part of a research univerity, not a traditional arts school. As there are over 200 majors and graduate programs at UC Davis, there is ample opportunity for students to work with others outside their area of study. A UCD Designer is well-rounded and able to communicate with teammates of a different background or mindset. We have the real-world experience that can only come with working with other fields on extracirricular projects. Collaboration with the Business School, Engineering Department, Cinema Studes, School of Education, and of course Agriculture and Sustainabilty programs transform our students into agile problem-solvers.</p>
    <h3>Company-to-Company <strong>[NETWORKING]</strong></h3>
    <p>Once you arrive at the fair and before booth set-up, you'll enjoy a complimentary breakfast and participate in our Morning Mingle. The Mingle gives profeshional atendees the chance to meet eachother and network before any students arrive. We've incorportated the Mingle this year because we believe that building a stronger design community comes from uniting not only students and employers profreshionals with oneanother. Once the fair has begun, you'll recieve lunch, interact with student-designed exhibitions, our [Insert Future Here]-themed photo booth, pick up some excellent plunder, and (of course) meet your next star hire!</p>
