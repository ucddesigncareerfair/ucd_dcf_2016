    <!-- <p>Look, some text! Now... Here is some more text! Now it is filler text, let's make more filler text. Look how fast I type Michelle, nope it's not fast at all. We will now proceed to compare Tara to a sloth once again. A sloth with the memory of an elephant. Hopefully. Gotta have something to make up for that slothliness. Michelle what do you want to be? A cat? I thought as much. So predictable. Such cat-like reflexes. Such speed and agility on the keyboard. Meow. Well that's all. End of Story. Tara has secretly left in this filler text for the curious to discover!</p> -->
    Why visit the Univesity of California at Davis on March 22nd, 2016? To find a rising star, to fill a vacancy, to review portfolios and help out young designers on the path to glory and skillfullness. But what else?
    <h6>Why hire from UC Davis? Why attend this fair, this April?</h6>
    <br>Two reasons: Davis Designers are more than just designers, and our career fair is more than just passing out business cards. Multitalented students, profeshional networking, and plenty of interactive exhibits and free, fun swag await you!
    <!-- ***First Section: Students -->
    <h3><strong>[INTERDISCLIPINARY]</strong> Student Talent</h3>
    <p>Students in Design program at UC Davis beneif greatly from being part of a <b>research university</b> instead of a traditional arts school. With over 200 majors and graduate programs at UC Davis, there is ample opportunity for students to work with those outside their chosen field. <b>Dirvesity breeds innovation</b>, and a UCD Designer is well-rounded, able to collaborate with teammates of a different backgrounds, and communicate beyond barriers. We have the real-world experience that can only come from working with others on extracirricular projects. <b>Collaboration</b> with the Business School, Engineering Department, Cinema Studes, School of Education, and of course Agriculture and Sustainabilty programs transform our students into agile and creative problem-solvers.</p>
    <!-- ***Second Section: Networking -->
    <h3>Company-to-Company <strong>[NETWORKING]</strong></h3>
    <p>Once you arrive at the fair and before booth set-up, you'll enjoy a <b>complimentary breakfast</b> and participate in our <b>Morning Mingle</b>. The Mingle gives profeshional atendees the chance to meet each other and <b>network</b> before students arrive. We've incorportated the Mingle this year because we believe that building <b>a stronger design community</b> comes from uniting not only students and employers, but design profreshionals with one another. Once the fair has begun, you'll recieve lunch, interact with student-designed exhibitions, our [Insert Future Here]-themed <b>photo booth</b>, pick up some excellent plunder, and of course <b>meet your next star hire!</b></p>
