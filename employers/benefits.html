    <p>Why visit the University of California at Davis on April 22nd, 2016? To find a rising star, to fill a vacancy, to review portfolios and to help out young designers on the path to glory and skillfullness. But what else? Why hire from UC Davis, and why attend this fair, this April? Two reasons: Davis Designers are more than just designers, and our career fair is more than just about passing out business cards. Multi-talented students, interactive exhibits, professional networking, and plenty of swag await you!</p>
    <h3><strong>[INTERDISCLIPINARY]</strong> Student Talent</h3>
    <p>Students in the Design program at UC Davis benefit from being part of a research univerity, not a traditional arts school. As there are over 200 majors and graduate programs at UC Davis, there is ample opportunity for students to work with others outside their area of study. A UCD Designer is well-rounded and able to communicate with teammates of a different background or mindset. We have the real-world experience that can only come with working with other fields on extracurricular projects. Collaboration with the Business School, Engineering Department, Cinema Studes, School of Education, and Agriculture and Sustainabilty programs transform our students into agile problem-solvers.</p>
    <h3>Company-to-Company <strong>[NETWORKING]</strong></h3>
    <p>Once you arrive at the fair and before booth set-up, you will enjoy a complimentary breakfast and participate in our Morning Mingle. The Mingle gives professional atendees the chance to meet each other and network before any students arrive. We have incorporated the Mingle this year because we believe that building a stronger design community comes from uniting not only students and employers, but also uniting professionals with one another. Once the fair has begun, you'll receive lunch, interact with student-designed exhibitions, our [Insert Future Here]-themed photo booth, pick up some excellent plunder, and (of course) meet your next star hire!</p>
